# CollisionGrid  

This class implements a collision-grid.  
When doing game development you've all come across a point when you'd like to do some collision-checks and that's usually the time when you realize that just checking all sprites against each other just doesn't cut it.  
The problem is that the number of checks grow very fast (N² for N sprites) when the number of your sprites grow.
