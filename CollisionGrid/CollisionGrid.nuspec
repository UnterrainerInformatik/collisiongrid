    <description>
		When doing game development you've all come across a point when you'd like to do some collision-checks and that's usually the time when you realize that just checking all sprites against each other just doesn't cut it.
		The problem is that the number of checks grow very fast (NÂ² for N sprites) when the number of your sprites grow.
		So you somehow have to narrow down your collision-candidates. This piece of software does that for you. It does not do collision checking itself. It just tells you if a sprite is near enough to a second one to maybe collide which allows you to do a collision test for those two, or three, or five...
		This is a PCL, so you should be able to use it in any of your MG projects.
